<p>6a. Create a variable called `hour` and save the current hour of th day (use 24-hour format and save it as a number between 0 and 23).</p>
 <ul>
    <li>if hour is between 6 and 12, display `Good morning!` in the console</li>
    <li>if hour is between 13 and 17, display `Good afternoon!` in the console</li>
    <li>Otherwise, display `Good night!` in the console</li>
</ul>

<p>6b. Continuing form 6a, try changing the value in the `hour` variable to make it display different messages.</p>

<p>6c. Continuing form 6a, create a variable called `name` and save your name inside (as string).
    Update the if-statement to display your name in each message. For example: ` Good morning ${name}! </p>

<p>6d. Imagine an amusement park that has a discount for children (6 years and younger) or seniors (65 years and older).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a variable `age` and save a person's age inside.</li>
    <li>Create an if-statement that checks if the person qualifies for discount. If they do, display 'Discount' in the console. Otherwise, display 'No discount' in the console.
        <br> NOTE : try to use the || Operator in your solution.</li>
    <li>Try changing the 'age' variable to display different messages. </li>
</ul>

<p>6e. Continuing from exercise 6d. let's say the discount is only available if it is not a holiday. Create a variable: const isHoliday = true;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Update the code so that in order to get a discount, people must meet the age requirement, and it is also not a holiday.
    <br>Note: && has a higher priority than || so you may need to use brackets () to control which code gets done first.</li>
    <li>try changing the value of isHoliday to display different message.</li>
</ul>
